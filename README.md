# SignTrans: Sign Language Translation

SignTrans is a web application that uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to translate text to sign language. The goal of this project is to bridge language gaps and enhance communication with others by promoting accessibility and inclusiveness.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Django
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- NLP(natural language processing)

## How it Works

The SignTrans application uses natural language processing techniques to preprocess and analyze text. This includes tokenization, which involves breaking down the text into individual words or tokens, and word processing techniques like stemming and lemmatization, which involve reducing words to their base forms. A machine learning model is then used to generate a sequence of sign language gestures that correspond to the input text. The sequence of gestures is then displayed to the user in the form of a video.

## How to Use
